This method issupported for the benefit of hash tables such as those provided by{@link java.util.HashMap}.\n            The general contract of {@code hashCode} is:\n            \n            Whenever it is invoked on the same object more than once during     an execution of a Java application, the {@code hashCode} method     must consistently return the same integer, provided no information     used in {@code equals} comparisons on the object is modified.     This integer need not remain consistent from one execution of an     application to another execution of the same application.\n            If two objects are equal according to the {@code equals(JObject)}     method, then calling the {@code hashCode} method on each of     the two objects must produce the same integer result.\n            It is not required that if two objects are unequal     according to the {@link java.lang.JObject#equals(java.lang.JObject)}     method, then calling the {@code hashCode} method on each of the     two objects must produce distinct integer results.  However, the     programmer should be aware that producing distinct integer results     for unequal objects may improve the performance of hash tables.\n            As much as is reasonably practical, the hashCode method defined byclass {@code JObject} does return distinct integers for distinctobjects. (This is typically implemented by converting the internaladdress of the object into an integer, but this implementationtechnique is not required by theJava™ programming language.)\n            \n

is \"equal to\" this one.\n            The {@code equals} method implements an equivalence relationon non-null object references:\n            \n            It is reflexive: for any non-null reference _value     {@code x}, {@code x.equals(x)} should return     {@code true}.\n            It is symmetric: for any non-null reference values     {@code x} and {@code y}, {@code x.equals(y)}     should return {@code true} if and only if     {@code y.equals(x)} returns {@code true}.\n            It is transitive: for any non-null reference values     {@code x}, {@code y}, and {@code z}, if     {@code x.equals(y)} returns {@code true} and     {@code y.equals(z)} returns {@code true}, then     {@code x.equals(z)} should return {@code true}.\n            It is consistent: for any non-null reference values     {@code x} and {@code y}, multiple invocations of     {@code x.equals(y)} consistently return {@code true}     or consistently return {@code false}, provided no     information used in {@code equals} comparisons on the     objects is modified.\n            For any non-null reference _value {@code x},     {@code x.equals(null)} should return {@code false}.\n            The {@code equals} method for class {@code JObject} implementsthe most discriminating possible equivalence relation on objects;that is, for any non-null reference values {@code x} and{@code y}, this method returns {@code true} if and onlyif {@code x} and {@code y} refer to the same object({@code x == y} has the _value {@code true}).\n            Note that it is generally necessary to override the {@code hashCode}method whenever this method is overridden, so as to maintain thegeneral contract for the {@code hashCode} method, which statesthat equal objects must have equal hash codes.\n            \n

The precise meaningof \"copy\" may depend on the class of the object. The generalintent is that, for any object {@code x}, the expression:\n            \n            x.clone() != xwill be true, and that the expression:\n            \n            x.clone().getClass() == x.getClass()will be {@code true}, but these are not absolute requirements.While it is typically the case that:\n            \n            x.clone().equals(x)will be {@code true}, this is not an absolute requirement.\n            By convention, the returned object should be obtained by calling{@code super.clone}.  If a class and all of its superclasses (except{@code JObject}) obey this convention, it will be the case that{@code x.clone().getClass() == x.getClass()}.\n            By convention, the object returned by this method should be independentof this object (which is being cloned).  To achieve this independence,it may be necessary to modify one or more fields of the object returnedby {@code super.clone} before returning it.  Typically, this meanscopying any mutable objects that comprise the internal \"deep structure\"of the object being cloned and replacing the references to theseobjects with references to the copies.  If a class contains onlyprimitive fields or references to immutable objects, then it is usuallythe case that no fields in the object returned by {@code super.clone}need to be modified.\n            The method {@code clone} for class {@code JObject} performs aspecific cloning operation. First, if the class of this object doesnot implement the interface {@code Cloneable}, then a{@code CloneNotSupportedException} is thrown. Note that all arraysare considered to implement the interface {@code Cloneable} and thatthe return type of the {@code clone} method of an array type {@code T[]}is {@code T[]} where T is any reference or primitive type.Otherwise, this method creates a new instance of the class of thisobject and initializes all its fields with exactly the contents ofthe corresponding fields of this object, as if by assignment; thecontents of the fields are not themselves cloned. Thus, this methodperforms a \"shallow copy\" of this object, not a \"deep copy\" operation.\n            The class {@code JObject} does not itself implement the interface{@code Cloneable}, so calling the {@code clone} method on an objectwhose class is {@code Object} will result in throwing anexception at run time.\n            \n                                        \n                                        \n                                        \n                                            Returns:     JObject\n            \n                                        \n                                            \n                                                \n                                            \n                                \n                            \n                        \n                    \n                    \n                        \n                            \n                                \n                                    Public toString\n                                \n                            \n            \n                            \n                                \n                                        \n                                            \n                                        \n                                    toString()\n                                \n                            \n            \n                            \n                                \n                                        Returns a string representation of the object.

Only objects that are instances of thisclass (or one of its subclasses) are thrown by the Java Virtual Machine orcan be thrown by the Java {@code throw} statement. Similarly, onlythis class or one of its subclasses can be the argument type in a{@code catch} clause.\nFor the purposes of compile-time checking of exceptions, {@codeThrowable} and any subclass of {@code Throwable} that is not also asubclass of either {@link RuntimeException} or {@link Error} areregarded as checked exceptions.\nInstances of two subclasses, {@link java.lang.Error} and{@link java.lang.Exception}, are conventionally used to indicatethat exceptional situations have occurred. Typically, these instancesare freshly created in the context of the exceptional situation soas to include relevant information (such as stack trace data).\nA throwable contains a snapshot of the execution stack of itsthread at the time it was created. It can also contain a messagestring that gives more information about the error. Over time, athrowable can {@linkplain Throwable#addSuppressed suppress} otherthrowables from being propagated.  Finally, the throwable can alsocontain a cause: another throwable that caused thisthrowable to be constructed.  The recording of this causal informationis referred to as the chained exception facility, as thecause can, itself, have a cause, and so on, leading to a \"chain\" ofexceptions, each caused by another.\nOne reason that a throwable may have a cause is that the class thatthrows it is built atop a lower layered abstraction, and an operation onthe upper layer fails due to a failure in the lower layer.  It would be baddesign to let the throwable thrown by the lower layer propagate outward, asit is generally unrelated to the abstraction provided by the upper layer.Further, doing so would tie the API of the upper layer to the details ofits implementation, assuming the lower layer's exception was a checkedexception.  Throwing a \"wrapped exception\" (i.e., an exception containing acause) allows the upper layer to communicate the details of the failure toits caller without incurring either of these shortcomings.  It preservesthe flexibility to change the implementation of the upper layer withoutchanging its API (in particular, the set of exceptions thrown by itsmethods).\nA second reason that a throwable may have a cause is that the methodthat throws it must conform to a general-purpose interface that does notpermit the method to throw the cause directly.  For example, supposea persistent collection conforms to the {@link java.util.CollectionCollection} interface, and that its persistence is implemented atop{@code java.io}.  Suppose the internals of the {@code add} methodcan throw an {@link java.io.IOException IOException}.  The implementationcan communicate the details of the {@code IOException} to its callerwhile conforming to the {@code Collection} interface by wrapping the{@code IOException} in an appropriate unchecked exception.  (Thespecification for the persistent collection should indicate that it iscapable of throwing such exceptions.)\nA cause can be associated with a throwable in two ways: via aconstructor that takes the cause as an argument, or via the{@link #initCause(Throwable)} method.  New throwable classes thatwish to allow causes to be associated with them should provide constructorsthat take a cause and delegate (perhaps indirectly) to one of the{@code Throwable} constructors that takes a cause.\nBecause the {@code initCause} method is public, it allows a cause to beassociated with any throwable, even a \"legacy throwable\" whoseimplementation predates the addition of the exception chaining mechanism to{@code Throwable}.\nBy convention, class {@code Throwable} and its subclasses have twoconstructors, one that takes no arguments and one that takes a{@code String} argument that can be used to produce a detail message.Further, those subclasses that might likely have a cause associated withthem should have two more constructors, one that takes a{@code Throwable} (the cause), and one that takes a{@code String} (the detail message) and a {@code Throwable} (thecause).\n\n            \n\n            \n                Constructor\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                                \n                                    constructor(args: any[])\n                                \n                            \n            \n                            \n                                \n                                        Constructs a new throwable with {@code null} as its detail message.The cause is not initialized, and may subsequently be initialized by acall to {@link #initCause}.\n            The {@link #fillInStackTrace()} method is called to initializethe stack trace data in the newly created throwable.Constructs a new throwable with the specified detail message.  Thecause is not initialized, and may subsequently be initialized bya call to {@link #initCause}.\n            The {@link #fillInStackTrace()} method is called to initializethe stack trace data in the newly created throwable.Constructs a new throwable with the specified detail message andcause.  Note that the detail message associated with{@code cause} is not automatically incorporated inthis throwable's detail message.\n            The {@link #fillInStackTrace()} method is called to initializethe stack trace data in the newly created throwable.Constructs a new throwable with the specified cause and a detailmessage of {@code (cause==null ? null : cause.toString())} (whichtypically contains the class and detail message of {@code cause}).This constructor is useful for throwables that are little more thanwrappers for other throwables (for example, {@link java.security.PrivilegedActionException}).\n            The {@link #fillInStackTrace()} method is called to initializethe stack trace data in the newly created throwable.Constructs a new throwable with the specified detail message,cause, {@linkplain #addSuppressed suppression} enabled ordisabled, and writable stack trace enabled or disabled.  Ifsuppression is disabled, {@link #getSuppressed} for this objectwill return a zero-length array and calls to {@link\n             #addSuppressed} that would otherwise append an exception to thesuppressed list will have no effect.  If the writable stacktrace is false, this constructor will not call {@link\n             #fillInStackTrace()}, a {@code null} will be written to the{@code stackTrace} field, and subsequent calls to {@codefillInStackTrace} and {@link\n             #setStackTrace(StackTraceElement[])} will not set the stacktrace.  If the writable stack trace is false, {@link\n             #getStackTrace} will return a zero length array.\n            Note that the other constructors of {@code Throwable} treatsuppression as being enabled and the stack trace as beingwritable.  Subclasses of {@code Throwable} should document anyconditions under which suppression is disabled and documentconditions under which the stack trace is not writable.Disabling of suppression should only occur in exceptionalcircumstances where special requirements exist, such as avirtual machine reusing exception objects under low-memorysituations.  Circumstances where a given exception object isrepeatedly caught and rethrown, such as to implement controlflow between two sub-systems, is another situation whereimmutable throwable objects would be appropriate.\n            \n                                \n                            \n                        \n                    \n            \n\n            \n                Methods\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                                \n                                    Public getCause\n                                \n                            \n            \n                            \n                                \n                                        \n                                            \n                                        \n                                    getCause()\n                                \n                            \n            \n                            \n                                \n                                        Returns the cause of this throwable or {@code null} if thecause is nonexistent or unknown.  (The cause is the throwable thatcaused this throwable to get thrown.)\n            This implementation returns the cause that was supplied via one ofthe constructors requiring a {@code Throwable}, or that was set aftercreation with the {@link #initCause(Throwable)} method.  While it istypically unnecessary to override this method, a subclass can overrideit to return a cause set by some other means.  This is appropriate fora \"legacy chained throwable\" that predates the addition of chainedexceptions to {@code Throwable}.  Note that it is notnecessary to override any of the {@code PrintStackTrace} methods,all of which invoke the {@code getCause} method to determine thecause of a throwable.\n            \n                                        \n                                        \n                                        \n                                            Returns:     JThrowable\n            \n                                        \n                                            \n                                                \n                                            \n                                \n                            \n                        \n                    \n                    \n                        \n                            \n                                \n                                    Public getMessage\n                                \n                            \n            \n                            \n                                \n                                        \n                                            \n                                        \n                                    getMessage()\n                                \n                            \n            \n                            \n                                \n                                        Returns the detail message string of this throwable.\n            \n                                        \n                                        \n                                        \n                                            Returns:     string\n            \n                                        \n                                            \n                                                \n                                            \n                                \n                            \n                        \n                    \n                    \n                        \n                            \n                                \n                                    Public toString\n                                \n                            \n            \n                            \n                                \n                                        \n                                            \n                                        \n                                    toString()\n                                \n                            \n            \n                            \n                                \n                                        Returns a short description of this throwable.The result is the concatenation of:\n            \n             the {@linkplain Class#getName() name} of the class of this object\n             \": \" (a colon and a space)\n             the result of invoking this object's {@link #getLocalizedMessage}      methodIf {@code getLocalizedMessage} returns {@code null}, then justthe class name is returned.\n            \n                                        \n                                        \n                                        \n                                            Returns:     string\n            \n                                        \n                                            \n                                                \n                                            \n                                \n                            \n                        \n                    \n            \n\n\n    \n    \n        import {JSerializable} from '../../java.io/src/jserializable';\nimport {Jboolean, is} from './jboolean_primitive';\nimport {JObject} from './jobject';\n\n/**\n * The {@code Throwable} class is the superclass of all errors and\n * exceptions in the Java language.

After creation, its length is fixed.Each item in an array is called an element, and each element is accessed by its numerical index.Arrays are objects, are dynamically created, and may be assigned to variables of type JObject.All methods of class JObject may be invoked on an array.\n\n            \n\n            \n                Constructor\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                                \n                                    constructor(arg: T[] | Jint)\n                                \n                            \n            \n                            \n                                \n                                        Initialize an empty array of the specified size.Initialize an array with the specified values, inferring its size.\n            \n                                \n                            \n                        \n                    \n            \n\n            \n                Methods\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                                \n                                    Public set\n                                \n                            \n            \n                            \n                                \n                                        \n                                            \n                                        \n                                    set(index: Jint, value: T)\n                                \n                            \n            \n                            \n                                \n                                        Sets the specified value in the specified index of the array.

               By default, the Jint data type is a 32-bit signed two's complement integer,which has a minimum _value of -2^31 and a maximum _value of 2^31-1.In Java SE 8 and later, you can use the jint data type to represent an unsigned32-bit integer, which has a minimum _value of 0 and a maximum _value of 2^32-1.Use the Integer class to use jint data type as an unsigned integer.See the section The Number Classes for more information.Static methods like compareUnsigned, divideUnsigned etc have been added tothe Integer class to support the arithmetic operations for unsigned integers.\nNote: To retrieve the actual numeric value wrapped in a Jint you have to use .value syntax.\n\n            \n\n            \n                Constructor\n                    \n                        \n

This interface allows annotations to be read reflectively.  Allannotations returned by methods in this interface are immutable andserializable. The arrays returned by methods of this interface may be modifiedby callers without affecting the arrays returned to other callers.\nThe {@link #getAnnotationsByType(Class)} and {@link#getDeclaredAnnotationsByType(Class)}methods support multiple annotations of the same type on an element.If the argument to either method is a repeatable annotation type (JLS 9.6),then the method will \"look through\" a container annotation (JLS 9.7),if present, and return any annotations inside the container.Container annotations may be generated at compile-time to wrap multipleannotations of the argument type.\nThe terms directly present, indirectly present,present, and associated are used throughout thisinterface to describe precisely which annotations are returned bymethods:\n An annotation A is directly present on anelement E if E has a {@codeRuntimeVisibleAnnotations} or {@codeRuntimeVisibleParameterAnnotations} or {@codeRuntimeVisibleTypeAnnotations} attribute, and the attributecontains A.An annotation A is indirectly present on anelement E if E has a {@code RuntimeVisibleAnnotations} or{@code RuntimeVisibleParameterAnnotations} or {@code RuntimeVisibleTypeAnnotations}attribute, and A 's type is repeatable, and the attribute containsexactly one annotation whose _value element contains A and whosetype is the containing annotation type of A 's type.An annotation A is present on an element E if either:A is directly present on E; orNo annotation of A 's type is directly present onE, and E is a class, and A 's type isinheritable, and A is present on the superclass of E.\n\nAn annotation A is associated with an element Eif either:\nA is directly or indirectly present on E; orNo annotation of A 's type is directly or indirectlypresent on E, and E is a class, and A's typeis inheritable, and A is associated with the superclass ofE.\n\n\nThe table below summarizes which kind of annotation presencedifferent methods in this interface examine.\nOverview of kind of presence detected by different AnnotatedElement methodsKind of PresenceMethodDirectly PresentIndirectly PresentPresentAssociated{@code T}{@link #getAnnotation(Class) getAnnotation(Class)}X{@code Annotation[]}{@link #getAnnotations getAnnotations()}X{@code T[]}{@link #getAnnotationsByType(Class) getAnnotationsByType(Class)}X{@code T}{@link #getDeclaredAnnotation(Class) getDeclaredAnnotation(Class)}X{@code Annotation[]}{@link #getDeclaredAnnotations getDeclaredAnnotations()}X{@code T[]}{@link #getDeclaredAnnotationsByType(Class) getDeclaredAnnotationsByType(Class)}XX\n\nFor an invocation of {@code get[Declared]AnnotationsByType( Class T >)}, the order of annotations which are directly or indirectlypresent on an element E is computed as if indirectly presentannotations on E are directly present on E in placeof their container annotation, in the order in which they appear inthe _value element of the container annotation.\nThere are several compatibility concerns to keep in mind if anannotation type T is originally not repeatable andlater modified to be repeatable.\nThe containing annotation type for T is TC.\nModifying T to be repeatable is source and binarycompatible with existing uses of T and with existing usesof TC.That is, for source compatibility, source code with annotations oftype T or of type TC will still compile. For binarycompatibility, class files with annotations of type T or oftype TC (or with other kinds of uses of type T or oftype TC) will link against the modified version of Tif they linked against the earlier version.(An annotation type TC may informally serve as an actingcontaining annotation type before T is modified to beformally repeatable. Alternatively, when T is maderepeatable, TC can be introduced as a new type.)If an annotation type TC is present on an element, andT is modified to be repeatable with TC as itscontaining annotation type then:The change to T is behaviorally compatible with respectto the {@code get[Declared]Annotation(Class)} (called with anargument of T or TC) and {@codeget[Declared]Annotations()} methods because the results of themethods will not change due to TC becoming the containingannotation type for T.The change to T changes the results of the {@codeget[Declared]AnnotationsByType(Class)} methods called with anargument of T, because those methods will now recognize anannotation of type TC as a container annotation for Tand will \"look through\" it to expose annotations of type T.\n\nIf an annotation of type T is present on anelement and T is made repeatable and more annotations oftype T are added to the element:\n The addition of the annotations of type T is bothsource compatible and binary compatible.The addition of the annotations of type T changes the resultsof the {@code get[Declared]Annotation(Class)} methods and {@codeget[Declared]Annotations()} methods, because those methods will nowonly see a container annotation on the element and not see anannotation of type T.The addition of the annotations of type T changes theresults of the {@code get[Declared]AnnotationsByType(Class)}methods, because their results will expose the additionalannotations of type T whereas previously they exposed only asingle annotation of type T.\n\n\nIf an annotation returned by a method in this interface contains(directly or indirectly) a {@link Class}-valued member referring toa class that is not accessible in this VM, attempting to read the classby calling the relevant Class-returning method on the returned annotationwill result in a {@link TypeNotPresentException}.\nSimilarly, attempting to read an enum-valued member will result ina {@link EnumConstantNotPresentException} if the enum constant in theannotation is no longer present in the enum type.\nIf an annotation type T is (meta-)annotated with an{@code @Repeatable} annotation whose _value element indicates a typeTC, but TC does not declare a {@code _value()} methodwith a return type of T{@code []}, then an exception of type{@link java.lang.annotation.AnnotationFormatError} is thrown.\nFinally, attempting to read a member whose definition has evolvedincompatibly will result in a {@link java.lang.annotation.AnnotationTypeMismatchException} or an{@link java.lang.annotation.IncompleteAnnotationException}.\n\n            \n\n\n\n    \n    \n        export interface JAnnotatedElement {\n  /**\n   * Returns this element's annotation for the specified type if\n   * such an annotation is present, else null.\n   *\n   * @param  the type of the annotation to query for and return if present\n   * @param annotationClass the Class object corresponding to the\n   *        annotation type\n   * @return this element's annotation for the specified annotation type if\n   *     present on this element, else null\n   * @throws NullPointerException if the given annotation class is null\n   * @since 1.5\n   */\n  // getAnnotation(annotationClass: JClass): T;\n\n  /**\n   * Returns annotations that are present on this element.\n   *\n   * If there are no annotations present on this element, the return\n   * _value is an array of length 0.\n   *\n   * The caller of this method is free to modify the returned array; it will\n   * have no effect on the arrays returned to other callers.\n   *\n   * @return annotations present on this element\n   * @since 1.5\n   */\n  // getAnnotations(): JArray\n\n  /**\n   * Returns annotations that are associated with this element.\n   *\n   * If there are no annotations associated with this element, the return\n   * _value is an array of length 0.\n   *\n   * The difference between this method and {@link #getAnnotation(Class)}\n   * is that this method detects if its argument is a repeatable\n   * annotation type (JLS 9.6), and if so, attempts to find one or\n   * more annotations of that type by \"looking through\" a container\n   * annotation.\n   *\n   * The caller of this method is free to modify the returned array; it will\n   * have no effect on the arrays returned to other callers.\n   *\n   * @implSpec The default implementation first calls {@link\n    * #getDeclaredAnnotationsByType(Class)} passing {@code\n   * annotationClass} as the argument.

This ordering is referred to as the class's naturalordering, and the class's compareTo method is referred to asits natural comparison method.\nLists (and arrays) of objects that implement this interface can be sortedautomatically by Collections.sort) (andArrays.sort)).  Objects that implement thisinterface can be used as keys in a {@linkplain SortedMap sorted map} or aselements in a {@linkplain SortedSet sorted set}, without the need tospecify a {@linkplain Comparator comparator}.\nThe natural ordering for a class C is said to be consistentwith equals if and only if e1.compareTo(e2) == 0 hasthe same boolean value as e1.equals(e2) for every\ne1 and e2 of class C.  Note that nullis not an instance of any class, and e.compareTo(null) shouldthrow a NullPointerException even though e.equals(null)returns false.\nIt is strongly recommended (though not required) that natural orderings beconsistent with equals.  This is so because sorted sets (and sorted maps)without explicit comparators behave \"strangely\" when they are used withelements (or keys) whose natural ordering is inconsistent with equals.  Inparticular, such a sorted set (or sorted map) violates the general contractfor set (or map), which is defined in terms of the equalsmethod.\nFor example, if one adds two keys a and b such that{@code (!a.equals(b) && a.compareTo(b) == 0)} to a sortedset that does not use an explicit comparator, the second addoperation returns false (and the size of the sorted set does not increase)because a and b are equivalent from the sorted set'sperspective.\nVirtually all Java core classes that implement Comparable have naturalorderings that are consistent with equals.  One exception is\njava.math.BigDecimal, whose natural ordering equates\nBigDecimal objects with equal values and different precisions(such as 4.0 and 4.00).\nFor the mathematically inclined, the relation that definesthe natural ordering on a given class C is:       {(x, y) such that x.compareTo(y)  The quotient for this total order is:        {(x, y) such that x.compareTo(y) == 0}.\nIt follows immediately from the contract for compareTo that thequotient is an equivalence relation on C, and that thenatural ordering is a total order on C.  When we say that aclass's natural ordering is consistent with equals, we mean that thequotient for the natural ordering is the equivalence relation defined bythe class's equals(Object)) method:     {(x, y) such that x.equals(y)}. \nThis interface is a member of theJava Collections Framework. the type of objects that this object may be compared to\n\n            \n\n            \n                Methods\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                                \n                                     compareTo\n                                \n                            \n            \n                            \n                                \n            compareTo(o: T)\n                                \n                            \n            \n                            \n                                \n                                        Compares this object with the specified object for order.  Returns anegative integer, zero, or a positive integer as this object is lessthan, equal to, or greater than the specified object.\n            The implementor must ensure sgn(x.compareTo(y)) ==-sgn(y.compareTo(x)) for all x and y.  (Thisimplies that x.compareTo(y) must throw an exception iff\n            y.compareTo(x) throws an exception.)\n            The implementor must also ensure that the relation is transitive:\n            (x.compareTo(y)>0 && y.compareTo(z)>0) implies\n            x.compareTo(z)>0.\n            Finally, the implementor must ensure that x.compareTo(y)==0implies that sgn(x.compareTo(z)) == sgn(y.compareTo(z)), forall z.\n            It is strongly recommended, but not strictly required that\n            (x.compareTo(y)==0) == (x.equals(y)).  Generally speaking, anyclass that implements the Comparable interface and violatesthis condition should clearly indicate this fact.

One exception is\n * java.math.BigDecimal, whose natural ordering equates\n * BigDecimal objects with equal values and different precisions\n * (such as 4.0 and 4.00).\n *\n * For the mathematically inclined, the relation that defines\n * the natural ordering on a given class C is:\n *       {(x, y) such that x.compareTo(y) &lt;= 0}.\n *  The quotient for this total order is: \n *       {(x, y) such that x.compareTo(y) == 0}.\n * \n *\n * It follows immediately from the contract for compareTo that the\n * quotient is an equivalence relation on C, and that the\n * natural ordering is a total order on C.  When we say that a\n * class's natural ordering is consistent with equals, we mean that the\n * quotient for the natural ordering is the equivalence relation defined by\n * the class's {@link Object#equals(Object) equals(Object)} method:\n *     {(x, y) such that x.equals(y)}. \n *\n * This interface is a member of the\n * \n * Java Collections Framework.\n *\n * @param  the type of objects that this object may be compared to\n *\n * @author  Josh Bloch\n * @see java.util.Comparator\n * @since 1.2\n */\nexport interface JComparable {\n  /**\n   * Compares this object with the specified object for order.
